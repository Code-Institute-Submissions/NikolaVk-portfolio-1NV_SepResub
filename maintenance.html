            <p>If you want to keep you're fence for a long time it's necesary to maintain it from time to time. Luckely there isn't that much maintenance needed here.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You'll only need to brin on another layer of wood stain every two to three years. The best way to do this is clean the entire fence and let it dry. After that some light sanding and add the layer of wood stain. This is only for softwood fences.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For hardwood fences you treat it al least once per year with a special oil.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Maintaining a nice hedge can sometimes be more trickier if you're unlucky. It dosen't happen that ofter, but a plant can die and get very ugly. You can't do anything about this but buying a new one and trying to match it with the rest of the hedge. It can also get eaten by different kind of bugs, however there are alot of resources to handle this that kill the plague.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But if all goes well a hedge isn't all that difficult. Once per year in spring you can add some outdoor plant food. With warm weather you can add alot of water. The hedge will certanly like all that. Also once per year if you want a straight hedge you can cut it up with sheers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For a recently planted hedge it's all the same accept you have to sometimes guide it the way you want it to grow.</p>

        </div><div class="con-txt">
            <p>A pavment dosen't require alot of maintenance. The biggest and most annoying thing that happends is that unwanted plants like to grow between the stones/tiles. You could remove them by hand from time to time, but you could also use poison to kill the plants. For people that dont want to use poison you can also get a burner. The only drawback is that it can smell alot.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There is also always a chanse that you're tile or stone can break. This mostly happens on a driveway from the weight of a car. Or by accidentaly dropping something on them. If you have some tiles/stones laying arround still you can easely replace them by removing the old one, evening the sand out and if necesary add some more in the gap. After that just put the new tile in and you're all good to go. Optional is to use some crusher sand for the tiny gaps.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another thing that can sadly happen is that the sand underneeth lowers and then you will have a hole in you're paving. Only option is remove all the stones/tiles in that area and add some more sant to it. Even it out and return the stones/tiles on top.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All of the above also counts for edging curbs. The process on maintenance is the same.</p>

        </div><div class="con-txt">
            <p>The basic thing to do with a lawn is to mow it from time to time, however this isn't the only maintenance a lawn requires if you wanna keep it nice and green for a long time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Grassroots like to breath and grow. For this they need fresh air. The roots can't always grow because most of the time there isn't enough mix between soil and sand. You can fix this problem by poking small holes in the the lawn. This way fresh air can get in there as well rain water can reach the roots so they grow more. You can do this once per year. </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you do get some bald spots in you're beautifull lawn you can always add some more seeds.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can also fertilize you're lawn. After mowing the lawn alot of important nutriants disapear. You can add more nutriants twice per year. You do this between march/april and juni/july.</p>

        </div><div class="con-txt">
            <p>Remember having a beautifull flower bed from when you just planted all the new plants in there. Sadly this dosen't always stay the same. A flower bed almost always has unwanted visitors. Plants you haven't planted there you're self. You can simply remove them, however most of them come back within a couple of months. This happends because with some weeds even if a tiny bit of they're root is left deep within the soil they always regrow. Removing them by hand is very difficult and you also can't use a burner this time arround because of all the other plants you do want to keep alive. You can however use poison to kill it and not to worry all other plants will remain.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another thing to do is to sometimes cut off bits of a plant. Mostly in the winter. The height depends on the plant, some plants you just cut off the flower other all the way to the soil. A tip if you buy new plants is to keep the little labels that come with them so you know the name of it.</p>
