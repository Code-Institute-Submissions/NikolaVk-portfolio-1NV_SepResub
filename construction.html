            <p>
                In this section I'll explain how to construct a fence. Before we start you must know there are two types of fences. There is a wooden fence, and a live fence. For wooden fences you can get different styles and heights from different types of wood. Live fencing also has many types such as a hedge from many different plants or a grid mesh with plants growing throug it. With live fences you can get creative and think of many ways to make you're fence. Here we'll focus wooden fences and  hedge's.</p>
                <br>
                <p >Before you start you make sure you have the following tools:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Shovel</p></li>
                    <li><p>Long level tool</p></li>
                    <li><p>Short level tool</p></li>
                    <li><p>Auger</p></li>
                    <li><p>Drill</p></li>
                    <li><p>Manual pile driver or Rubber sledgehammer</p></li>
                    <li><p>Paint brush</p></li>
                    <li><p>Measuring roll</p></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Once you chose you're style of wooden fence and know the location for it you start by making sure the ground is nice and even with a shovel.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>After that pinpoint the location of you're first pole. Once you figured that out use the auger to drill a hole straight down, not too deep because after that you're gonna need to use the pile driver or rubber sledgehammer to hit the pole deeper in the ground. My advice is use a pile driver, it's much easier. That way it will remain firm. Make sure to check the pole is level from all sides with the short level tool, if it's too late you'll have a hard time getting the pole back out, also make sure the pole isn't too deep otherwise you won't be able to secure the fence screen. Make sure the fence screen dosen't touch the ground otherwise it will start to rot away.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>Once you're done with the first pole it's easier to secure a thin rope to the pole and stretch it out in the direction the rest of the fence will be placed. Make sure to measure the screens before drilling the next hole, also always make sure you leave an extra centimeter because the the fence support brackets used to secure the screens on them also need a little space.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>For the next pole you can repeat the process from the first pole, just make sure it points the correct way. An extra thing you have to look out for now is to make sure all pole's are the same height. For that you can use the long level tool by putting one end on the first pole and the other end on the second one.</p></li>
                    <li><p>You could first finish putting all hole's in the ground, however just to be sure you could mount the screen onto the first two pole's. You mount them with mounting brachets using the drill to make the hole's in the poles first. The reason for this is to prevent the schrews from breaking inside the pole.</p></li>
                    <li><p>After all that you finished the construction of you're fence, there is only one last thing to do and that is to protect the fence from the weather by giving it a layer of wood stain. This is only necesary when the wood dosen't already have a layer from when it was made. You can check this at the place you bought it.</p></li>

                This section is if you dont want a wooden fence, but a green live one. It's much easier to make you do need to give it more attention as the time goes on. You also need to look check if the plant you're gonna be using has the correct growing conditions such as type of soil or is the location in the sun or shadow. It can also be slightly more expencive because you mostly need alot small plants or alot large plants, depending on how much privacy you want. Do the research and you will have a nice hedge at the end of the day.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Before you start you make sure you have the following tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Measuring roll</p></li>
                <li><p>Shovel</p></li>
                <li><p>Watering can or garden hose</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><p>So you did the research and you know what plant you want. First things first you need to know the distance, this way you can calculate how many plants you're gonna need. Smaller plants need a slightly smaller distance that larger ones. If you dont already know the distance use the measuring roll</p></li>
                <li><p>Now you have the correct ammount of plants you need. For smaller plants you could dig up a little trench where you're goning to place tha plants in. For large plants you can just dig up one hole per plant.</p></li>
                <li><p>After putting the plants in they're place you close up the hole/trench while making sure all tha plants are straight up.</p></li>
                <li><p>Doing all that you can now water the plants using a waterinc can or garden hose.</p></li>

            <p>
                In this section I'll explain how to lay down paving stones. There are many many different kinds of pavings. Many different sizes, colours, from tiles to stones. Whick ever one you chose they all have one core purpose and that is so you dont walk or park you're car on soil. Besides paving stones you also need edging kerbs. Here are also different types,colours and even materials. You must also take into account that you need sand and depending on what the paving is gonna be used for (path or driveway). If there will be alot of weight on the paving you need to dig out more soil out and replace it with sand. The reason for this is to make sure tha paving dosen't sink away. That's also the reason you need sand and not soil because sand is more sturdy that soil.</p>
                <br>
                <p >Before you start you make sure you have the following tools:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Shovel</p></li>
                    <li><p>Long level tool</p></li>
                    <li><p>Short level tool</p></li>
                    <li><p>Rubber sledgehammer</p></li>
                    <li><p>Measuring roll</p></li>
                    <li><p>Broom</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You're also gonna need one machine for this project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>plate type compactor</p></li>
                    <li><p>diamond saw</p></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Before even getting the stones you first need to know that the surface measurment is in m2 and m3 for the sand. You also must not forget to measure the total periphery. You need to do this for the edging kerbs.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>You got the sand or it was brought to you. You wanna if not already done so spread it out across the area you want the stones.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>After you bought or hired (recomended) the plate type compactor you wanna turn it on with ear protection and make sure go go over every single inch of the area at least once. Sometimes it's necesary to do it a second time after spreading the sand out some more.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>Next step is to put in the down the edging kerbs making sure they are level. Hit the curbs down with the rubber sledgehamer. If one of them is too long use the diamond saw to cut it up.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Before putting the stones down using the long level tool even the surface out. This does however take some skill because you also need to make sure you have a very small slant down to make sure that if it rains the water dosen't remain on the paving.</p></li>
                    <li><p>This is the easiest and most fun part of the project. You're gonna put the stones down. Now there are many different ways on putting them down. Once you figured that out you can put them all down. Now it can occur that you're gonna need to use the diamond say to cut the stones and fill in the last little gaps.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The final part is to add some crusher sand on top and fill in all the tiny gaps between the stones. Always leave a nice layer on top. This layer will dissapear in time.</p></li>
