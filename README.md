How to garden is a website made to try and get people to go outside and get green fingers. Is's mostly targeted for people who want to design, construct and maintain their own yard. Also for people who don't want or can't hire a landscaper because from own experience as being a landscaper myself it can get pretty expencive really quickly.

## Features 

### General

Every page has its own image so you know for sure you switched from one page to another
On the construction page theres a list of items within every section. Within that list are links that will open the tools page and it will automatically scroll down to that specific tool so the user knows how the tool looks like widouth having to go to a different website

### Header

The navigation bar has visual conformation on a computer when you hover over it.
The header is fixed so when you scroll down it will follow the user to the bottom so that the user never has to scroll back up when wanting to switch pages

### Hamburger menu

For mobile devices the navigation bar will dissapear and go into a hamburger menu. Here you can always see on which page you are due to the border it comes arround when on each page. I also made the letters bold so they are more vissible for certain users.

Within the footer you can find social links to the developer's pages. Just like the navigation bar the user will get visual conformation when hovering over one of the links. All links open in a new page.
