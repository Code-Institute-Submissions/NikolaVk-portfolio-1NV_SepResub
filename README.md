The "How to garden" website is made to try and get people to go outside and get green fingers. Is's mostly targeted for people who want to design, construct and maintain their own yard. Also for people who don't want or can't hire a landscaper because from own experience as being a landscaper myself it can get pretty expencive really quickly.

## UX

### Visitor stories

As a visitor of "How to Garden" I want/need:

1. I want to be able to understand the steps given to construct and/or maintain my garden

2. To know what tools I need to use and how they look like

3. To get tips and tricks on desighning my own garden

4. If I dont understand or need advice that I can contact someone for more information

5. Easy navigation from page to page

6. At least one image showing me how the final product should look like



## Features 

### General

Every page has its own image so you know for sure you switched from one page to another

### Navigation bar

The navigation bar has visual conformation on a computer when you hover over it.
The header is fixed so when you scroll down it will follow the user to the bottom so that the user never has to scroll back up when wanting to switch pages

### Hamburger menu

For mobile devices the navigation bar will dissapear and go into a hamburger menu. Here you can always see on which page you are due to the border it comes arround when on each page. I also made the letters bold so they are more vissible for certain users.

### Construction page

On the construction page theres a list of items within every section. Within that list are links that will open the tools page and it will automatically scroll down to that specific tool so the user knows how the tool looks like widouth having to go to a different website. The tools page also opens in a new tab so the user doesn't have to go back and forward.

### Contact page

The contact page is made for users who don't understand or have questions about construction, maintenance and tools.

### Footer

Within the footer you can find social links to the developer's pages. Just like the navigation bar the user will get visual conformation when hovering over one of the links. All links open in a new page.

## Styling

### Font

The fonts used for this site are Merryweather and Lato with a backup of Sans-serif:

- [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=merr) was used for all heading elements, I chose it for it's bold and classic look which is fitting for a gardening site.
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lat) was used for all other elements smaller elements. It's clearly readable and again has a classic look to it.

### Icons

- The icons come from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I used icons on the top of every page with the heading and every icon fits the page they were added on.

### Color Scheme

For this website I used three different colours:

- Yellow
- Dark green
- Lighter green

<img src="https://github.com/NikolaVk/portfolio-1NV/blob/master/assets/readme/colour-scheme.png" width="100%">

I also tested the colours with a [Constrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com). 

#### Dark and light green

This passes on all accept the color blindess test (score must be 500 or above), however these colors were only used in the header and footer with darkgreen being the background color, if you hover over the clickable elements a extra border will apear that shows the user they are hovering over it. On mobile devices I made these elements bolder.

#### Dark green and yellow

<img src="https://github.com/NikolaVk/portfolio-1NV/blob/master/assets/readme/contrastcheckerylwgrn.png" width="100%">

This color combination has a much better score for color blindness, but still not quite enough. For this reason the font is large and bold and only used as a header of each page. The user also gets convormation when on a different page due to a fitting image on them.
